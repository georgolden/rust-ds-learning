# Rust Data Structures Learning

A collection of interview-level exercises focusing on Rust data structures and algorithms.

## Current Exercises

### Vector Module
1. **Sliding Window Maximum**
   - Find maximum elements in sliding windows
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(k)

2. **Merge Intervals**
   - Merge overlapping intervals
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
